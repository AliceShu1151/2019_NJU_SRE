2018-07-24T19:27:01Z,discuss,"Hello @hcastilho
So, you are trying to pass pythonpath and django settings to run configuration, right?
Should not it be set in Django settings directly in PyCharm? It will be passed as env. variable then."
2018-07-24T20:10:00Z,discuss,Honestly I didn't even remember this PR.
2018-07-24T20:10:00Z,discuss,"Having slightly different settings for tests is something that I always do. Also I keep settings separate form the code and outside of site-packages. Probably I could have  worked around by setting PYTHONPATH and DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE in the tests configuration. But I have always called the django cli with these options explicitly, so I was surprised when they did not work (I avoid using env variables)."
2018-07-24T20:10:00Z,discuss,Other than someone else once in a while being also surprised I can see no other argument for including this PR. Which is apparently of very limited use.
